Description: # ZenitAI
        ## Description
        ZenitAI is a Python library focused on providing convenient tools for machine learning tasks. For now the library is focused on binary classification tasks.

        ## What's inside
        **The main component of the library:**
        A tool for conducting WOE-analysis in classification tasks on tabular data.

        It is a highly customizable class facilitating data transormation with almost no effort. Class uses standard `sklearn`-like interface for transformation

        **Library also includes:**
        1. some wrapper functionss allowing avoiding a considerable amount of boilerplate needed with working with `skikit-learn`.
        2. a tool for managing multiple launches of machine-learning models (in early development stage)
